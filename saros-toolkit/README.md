## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Highlights

- **Resilient Authentication Flow**  
  The primary dashboard layout (`src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`) implements a robust, two-factor verification (`isWalletChecked` and `isMinTimePassed`) to handle wallet state.  
  This eliminates the common redirect race condition in dApps and ensures a smooth loading experience.  

- **Performance-First Caching**  
  Uses `sessionStorage` to cache heavy data (pools, positions) for speed and fewer RPC calls.  

- **Modular & Type-Safe Components**  
  TypeScript + reusable components (`PoolList`, `PositionCard`, `AddLiquidity`, etc.) keep the codebase clean and extendable.  

- **Route Groups for Layouts**  
  Uses Next.js App Router‚Äôs Route Groups (`dashboard`) for consistent, protected layouts.
